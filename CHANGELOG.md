## 5.0.1 — Production-readiness patch

- Updated Android to compile/target SDK 36 with Android Gradle Plugin 8.10.1.
- Android AAB/APK scripts now generate the API configuration, build the web assets and sync Capacitor automatically.
- Android Gradle preflight blocks native builds when the API URL is missing or not HTTPS.
- Reworked the experimental heuristic into an ENSO Signal Score focused on signal strength/coherence, with data coverage shown separately.
- Removed the fabricated July 2026 emergency fallback; when no valid NOAA/cache data exists, the UI shows unavailable values instead of stale numbers.
- Reduced current-data client/CDN cache windows and explicitly bypassed browser/WebView cache for current API requests.
